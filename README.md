# What?
A static site generator that creates a markdown file
It takes a file or list of files and appends them in order in a new file

## project list
Use github API to get info about all repos 
* get the year it was created
* get the repo name
* get the description

do this for all repos  
sort them by year  
put them together in the format:  

## [year1]
### [title1]
[desc1]

### [title2]
[desc2]

## [year2]

### [title3]
[desc3]  
.  
.  
.  

Year should be in decending order  
Titles should be in Alphabetic order (or chronological order)



# Stretch goals
Update the markdown file every time a new repo is published/a description changes
