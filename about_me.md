# About me
Self-taught developer with 2+ years of experience in languages like Python, C#, Java and SQL. 
Deep knowledge about the python ecosystem and packages like numpy and pandas. 

I'm currently studying "Object oriented programming with AI" so at the point my course ends, 
I'll know about OOP principles and developing AI models.
